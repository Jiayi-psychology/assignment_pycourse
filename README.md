The project focuses on the anatomical scan and functional connectivity related to emotional faces. The anatomical scan image showed that certain brain regions, such as (-24, 0, -18), were activated during the processing of emotional faces. The histogram results suggested that a lower frequency of voxels reached higher t-stat values.
